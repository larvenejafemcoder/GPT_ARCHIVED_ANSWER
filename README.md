## üìú Full Git + SSH Setup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# === Git Identity ===
git config --global user.name "LarveneJafem"
git config --global user.email "tomkancaston@gmail.com"

# Optional: use SSH instead of HTTPS everywhere
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"

# === SSH Key Setup ===
SSH_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/id_kernelghost_larv06"

# Make sure .ssh exists
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Generate key if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$SSH_KEY" ]; then
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "tomkancaston@gmail.com" -f "$SSH_KEY"
fi

# Start ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add key to agent
ssh-add "$SSH_KEY"

# Create or update ~/.ssh/config
grep -q "Host github.com" ~/.ssh/config 2>/dev/null || cat <<EOF >> ~/.ssh/config

Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_kernelghost_larv06
EOF

# Optional: make known_hosts silence future warnings
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts 2>/dev/null

# === Done ===
echo "‚úÖ Git + SSH setup complete. Don't forget to add the public key to GitHub:"
echo
cat "${SSH_KEY}.pub"
echo
```

---

## üí° Usage

1. Save it as `setup_git_ssh.sh`
2. Make executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_git_ssh.sh
   ```
3. Run it:

   ```bash
   ./setup_git_ssh.sh
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ After running:

* You‚Äôll be fully GitHub-authenticated via SSH
* Your key is generated, added to agent, and saved
* Your Git identity is set
* No more password prompts, ever

## üß† Git + SSH Setup Problem Log (2025-07-02)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem 1: SSH Key Not Found**

**Error:**

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_kernelghost_larv06
No such file or directory
```

**Cause:** You saved the SSH key in `~/` instead of `~/.ssh/`
**Fix:** Moved it into the `~/.ssh/` directory, where `ssh` expects it.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem 2: SSH Agent Not Running**

**Error:**

```bash
Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
```

**Cause:** The `ssh-agent` process wasn‚Äôt started in your current terminal session.
**Fix:**

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_kernelghost_larv06
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem 3: Wrong Git Remote (HTTPS)**

**Error:**

```bash
Username for 'https://github.com':
Password authentication is no longer supported
```

**Cause:** You cloned using an HTTPS URL, and GitHub doesn't support passwords anymore.
**Fix:** Switched the remote to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:larvenejafemcoder/terminal_dotfiles.git
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem 4: SSH Key Not Offered to GitHub**

**Error:**

```bash
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

**Cause:** Your SSH key wasn‚Äôt being offered to GitHub, despite being added.
**Fixes Applied:**

* Created `~/.ssh/config` with:

  ```ini
  Host github.com
      HostName github.com
      User git
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_kernelghost_larv06
  ```
* Ensured the agent had the key loaded.
* Used `ssh -vT git@github.com` to debug.
* Confirmed the key was accepted by GitHub:

  ```
  Hi larvenejafemcoder! You've successfully authenticated...
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Result: GitHub SSH authentication working perfectly.

You're now:

* Git-ready
* SSH-authenticated
* Configured to use SSH automatically for all GitHub remotes
* Set up to never retype passwords or tokens again
